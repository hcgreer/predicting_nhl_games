##Overview
In this project I design a rating system for the National Hockey League (NHL) and perform Monte Carlo simulations to forecast and determine the potenial Stanely Cup Champion. By calculating expected probabilities and simulating the season multiple times, hopfully to provide insight into the probability of each team winning the prestigios Stanley Cup.

##Methodology
Rating System: By using a rating system that assigns a numerical value to each NHL team. This number is based of historical data and is used to compare each teams relative strength to each other.

Simulation: The simulations run through the entire 82 game season and the playoffs. Using the rating to help determine the winner. By running the simulations By running this repeatedly, the frequency of ehivh teams win the Stanley cup begin to emerge. The higher the frequency the more likly to win the stanley cup based on the given rating system.

##Limitations
The accuracy is only as good as the rating system and the rating system seems to be too overtuned and is heavily favoring teams that made the playoffs last year. For this reason the rating system needs to be improved.

##Conculsion
By using team rating and monte carlo simulation, this project aims to provide valuable insight in the probabilities of each team winning the Stanley Cup.
